Sociology is the study of human social interaction: families, schools, work, the park. Anywhere that people are interacting, sociology has something to offer about it.

The [Sociological Perspective](#sociological-perspective) is essential to understanding other cultures that may have unfamiliar customs.

When turning our attention inward, we can attempt to overcome our self-congratulatory biases by using [Critical Theory](./critical-theory) based on [Marx's](/humanities/history/germany/karl-marx) work.
