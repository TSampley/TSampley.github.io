title: Contention
description: 
---

1. contention is a natural phenomenon that should not be feared on its own - it arises from the difference in perspectives each individual acquires over their lifetime, influenced by their environments and genetics*.
2. contention often leads to heightened emotions, which are disruptive when individuals don't have appropriate** tools or experience to process them.
3. 

Number two highlights the importance of training prior to real-world or high-stakes scenarios where heightened emotions can influence hasty decisions or exacerbate situational blindness.

* - I personally believen that the environment/genetic distinction is largely cultural and otherwise arbitrary like the distinction between nature/artifice.
** - Appropriate is extremely subjective and largely determined by the controlling ethnic group; see [Tone Policing](./tone-policing).
