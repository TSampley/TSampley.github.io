title: Childhood Curiosity
description:

I cringe every time I hear a parent "correct" their child by saying "oh, no, you're too young for that."

Too often, it's the parent that is the barrier to growth for their own child. Most of us are taught to accept a superficial understanding of the world around us. We all go through a curious phase as children where we ask a thousand questions about everything, but most of our parents get annoyed fairly quickly, and we eventually learn that we can ask one question or possibly two, but any more than that risks annoyance, which has varying consequences depending on the household.

I think there's an appropriate way to introduce any idea to a child. Sex is famously uncomfortable to discuss with our children, but it's better for them to learn from their guardian than incidental experience, and it doesn't need to be presented in graphic detail. War is an extreme that I would prefer to hold off on discussing for as long as possible, but there are some times when it's a stark reality that we need to address, and yet, you still don't need to traumatize your child to get the essential ideas across. The main struggle that I think people have with topics like this is that we just don't know *how* to address them: we don't have established patterns of communication in general society for these topics with this audience.
