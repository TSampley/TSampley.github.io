title: Enemies of Humankind
content_rating: MA
---

Enemy - deriving from Latin and Spanish, literally "un-friend"[^1].
Humankind - derived from "human" and "kind"[^2], where "kind" ultimately refers to a familial relationship[^4], meant to indicate altruistic or generous behavior (cognate with "kindness"), and "human" with similar original meaning becoming oriented more broadly towards indicating the species[^3]; in combination, understood to refer to all of humanity as some ideal, cooperative, monolithic collective.

While most of humanity is actually in conflict with the rest in some ideological form, "civil society" operates around setting aside these differences to avoid violent conflict. Despite this, some individuals have demonstrated through their actions that they can be broadly considered enemies of humankind as a whole, usually through personal enrichment at the expense of the general populace of one or more regions.
