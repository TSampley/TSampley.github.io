TODO: demonstrate evolutionary advantages of contentious or agreeable individuals
- social sim of individuals exchanging information
- information content: location of food
- in each round, individuals are paired together
- one individual is chosen randomly to provide information about food
- the other individual can agree or disagree if they have different information based on agreeability trait
- disagreeing hurts personal reputation but improves chances of success finding food
- agreeing saves/improves personal reputation but risks failure finding food


- can we account for individuals with different levels of confidence/humility?
