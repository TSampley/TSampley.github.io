Politics concerns any human activity related to organizing for the sake of regulating human activity. The word derives from latin "polis" meaning "of the people"(citation needed), so any discussion or activity relating to the people is of a political nature. Even something as apolitical as attending a football game is technically a political action. The word today has unfortunately become conflated with [contentious](../sociology/contention).
