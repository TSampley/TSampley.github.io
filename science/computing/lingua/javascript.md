title: Javascript

--- 

Javascript was first invented by ____ in 19xx-xx as a simple way to add interactivity to websites, which also allows more application logic to be handled by the user over the transactional approach, reducing server load (relying *too* much on the client for execution, though is how you get client-auth vulnerabilities).

It is a dynamically and loosely typed system, notorious for bugs stemming from its "type-juggling".
