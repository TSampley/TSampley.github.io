## Electronegativity
Electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom or ion attracts an electron.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity

## Ionic Bonding
One of the two in a pair attracts the electron strongly enough that it spends the majority of the time

## Covalent Bonding
Each electron in the pair spends roughly the same amount of time around each atom but is still localized around the pair.

## Metallic Bonding
Electrons become delocallized and move freely in a "sea" of electrons around metal nuclei.
