Ecology is the field concerned with interactions between all forms of life.

Despite its reputation in human society, [competition](./competition) is a critical dynamic in ecosystems. All resources have an eventual limit even if far beyond the current capacity of some population; eventually, all resources will be subject to competition where members of a population, within or across species, all work to acquire the same limited resources. As unpleasant as it can be, it's important to understand the dynamics of competition.
