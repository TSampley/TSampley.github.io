Reasoning is best understood as a biological adaptation, rather than 
the high-minded philosophical activity it might have a reputation for. [Logic](../../philosophy/logic/) is worthy of higher regard, but reasoning gets conflated with it, only because the best reasoning is structured with logic; however, even without a scientific or rigorous understanding of the world around it, organisms benefit tremendously from being able to build causal models of their environment. Put simply, most animals are capable of some level of reasoning – it's not a big deal. **Reasoning** is the biological capacity to model one's environment and establish causal connections between observations, ideally to drive actions which take advantage of that causal understanding.
