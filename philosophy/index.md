## Introduction
Philosophy is an incredibly broad field that spans essentially all of human history – even when someone isn't intentionally practicing philosophy, when we ask questions about the nature of our existence, or make statements about what someone should or shouldn't do, we're engaging in different types of philosophy.

## Major Branches
[Epistemology](./epistemology/), [ontology](./ontology/), ethics, meta-physics, and many more.
