## Introduction
Epistemology is the study of knowledge, it's nature and limitations: what can be known and how.

### Personal Distinctions
I personally think it's important for people to be able to qualify their statements when sharing their ideas or perspective: the negotiation of information is much smoother when individuals acknowledge their reason – or lack-thereof – behind a perspective, and language as an expression of our internal thought processes can help to shape our thought patterns through careful articulation. Very often, people will claim they "know" something when at best the idea qualifies as a belief.

- Feel - the lowest level of certainty, often trusted as the strongest.
- Believe - a lower level of certainty; still at the intuitive level, but based on consistent experience.
- Think - a higher level of certainty; more rational than intuitive at this point.
- Know - a high level of certainty, based on sound reasoning grounded with strong evidence.
