Logic is a specific set of patterns, used to structure [reasoning](../../science/biology/reasoning),
which have special value in their correspondance and consistency
with reality. Using logic in our reasoning is understood to be
key to understanding the natural world and its laws.

[Mathematics](../../math/) is a specific type of logic that began
as a subfield of [philosophy](../) but, like many special fields, it has grown to become its own field entirely.
