## Flexibility and Foreboding

My landlady has helped me out tremendously by allowing me to pay rent month-to-month without committing to a lease. I didn't want to commit a 6 month lease anywhere since I'm trying to find a job and move out of the state, so I actually thought I would be going homeless again just to make moving away easier. This little unit isn't the greatest, but you can't expect much for $350 a month with utilities paid, and it's more than enough for me where I am right now.

I can't say I'm optimistic for the New Year. Like I thought, the fervor for Trump hasn't really subsided and I'm expecting things to get violent at some point.
