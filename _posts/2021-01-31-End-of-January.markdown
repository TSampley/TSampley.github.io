## Pragmatic Programming

I was happy to hear about Android bringing support for Java 11 language features. After working with Kotlin, going back to Java feels tedious and the verbosity I never minded is unbearable, so I'm relieved for the sake of anyone still working in Java on Android; although, I can't say I totally understand the effort on Google's part. Considering the legal battle with Oracle, I've been expecting Google to reduce dependency on Java. The migration away from Java to Kotlin by their developer base seemed to be a big victory.

## January 6th

I was expecting violence for sure – some kind of Republican counter-protest turned to riots – but the invasion of our country's capitol completely exceeded my expectations. How do we move forward from here when this kind of thing is even possible? Peaceful protests on a far smaller scale are shut down with extreme prejudice, but a raucous crowd – becoming progressively more and more aggressive, then attacking officers and security – is allowed to advance on the heart of our nation? I feel like a conspiracy nut for even considering this, but there must have been support from the inside in some form or another.
