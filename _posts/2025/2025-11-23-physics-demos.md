## Two Particles

Adjust the slider to change the distance between the two hydrogen atoms and observe how the force changes.

<canvas class="demo-box" id="force-between-hydrogens" style='background-color: black'></canvas>
<div>
<input type="range" name="distance" id="hydrogen-distance" min="0" max="100"/>
<label for="distance">Distance</label>
</div>

## Bulk

When a bunch of atoms are moving about freely in a space, these forces work in aggregate to create the basic properties of matter we can observe in the lab, like gas pressure.
