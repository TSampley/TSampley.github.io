This is the first post documenting my progress going through all my old
programming projects since high school. Most of them are incomplete. I had a
very bad habit of never finishing anything. As soon as the puzzle was solved and
I knew what I needed to do to finish a program, I lost interest and moved onto
something else.

I don't have any particular approach in mind; at the moment, I intend to go down
this lexicographically ordered list, but I might jump to a specific project if
I feel compelled.

This blog is a static site built using Jekyll. So far, it's a cute little tool
that seems to have good flexibility and potential, but I won't be worrying too
much about the appearance of this blog.
