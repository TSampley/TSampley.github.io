# Refreshing
I've been hopping around from idea to idea, experimenting with little bits of things again – not able to settle on any one thing – so I came back to my GitHub profile to see what repositories might catch my interest. I'd expected to go through my list of private repos, but I already have 3 good repos set public: Amulet, 3D-collisions, and Mandelbrot.

Amulet was a team project I "lead" in high school because the AP Comp Sci. II exam had been discontinued.

3D-collisions is representative of my continual interest in various simulations.

Mandelobrot is one of the earliest visual programs I made based on reading his book "Fractals and Chaos".

Each project relates to some of the ideas I've been playing with lately, so I thought it would be nice to use these as my test subjects, since I've been wanting to share something (but struggling to find anything worth sharing, always).

## Objectives

Amulet would have been written for desktop using Swing, so converting the UI components would be my primary concern at first. It may be presumptuous to say "components", though.

3D-collisions is another that was written for desktop but the main UI library was Java3D, unless I'm misremembering. Regardless of the library, I'll be converting it to cross-platform use, focusing on the maths of a simulation.

Mandelbrot would be fun to convert into a wallpaper generator. Bonus points for cross-platform UI.

I'm at the laundromat and I just switched my laundry to the dry cycle. Let's see how much I can get done in just under 30 minutes.
