## Cheaters, cheaters everywhere
In Software Engineering class, we started another group project. And yet again, one of my team members decided to cheat. As far as I'm aware, no one else in the group knew about it. This time, the team member collaborated with someone in another group and directly copied that portion of the project from them. Our entire group received a 0 for the assignment. I went from a high A to a low B with just one assignment. And yet again, it appears that the cheater is getting away with just a poor grade. It seems I misunderstood what "zero tolerance" means. There are followup assignments yet to come and all I can do is hope that the cheater doesn't try to cheat again since the penalty is apparently insignificant.
