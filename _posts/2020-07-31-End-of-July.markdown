## Professional Programming Productivity

Through the App Center, I've been introduced to Azure DevOps, and I been loving it! For my own projects, I've used some of the project management tools that GitHub provides, but I had mainly been using Kanbans through Trello.

I recently created my own private DevOps project to manage an app idea I had. For now I'm calling it "Accountability", but I definitely think it needs a better name. All I'll say is that it's a personal safety app meant to help users keep better records of potentially dangerous encounters.

While I'm on the topic of tools â€“ I've decided to try a trial of Adobe Illustrator. It should be no surprise that the Android Studio Vector Asset dialog doesn't allow fine control over the assets, but in the past it's been enough for me to create a simple icon. Now that I'm releasing something that I'd like to be taken seriously, I figured I should learn a little Adobe Illustrator while I'm at it.

When I was much younger, I was very creative and enjoyed drawing quite a bit. I think I fell out of it because it started to feel silly - like I wasn't accomplishing anything. That would have been some time in middle school.

Images have a significant impact on the reception of a product or message. I want to hone this skill because I understand now how much utility it provides.

I'm always eager to learn something new, and I'm excited to get back into a form of expression that once brought me immense pleasure to practice.

## Family isn't who you're born with

I finally rented a public storage unit and moved all my property out of my parents' house. It was a cathartic experience to drive away for the last time, knowing I would never have another reason to go back to the place that holds so many horrible memories and see those disgusting faces again.
