## New Responsibilities
September started off strong with my boss giving me some extra responsibility. I had been paranoid about getting dropped since I'm taking much longer on an issue than I originally anticipated thanks to all this technical debt, so it was nice to see she was willing to put some trust in me. 

## New Experiences
Despite the strong start, September ended poorly. My chef's knife was a bit dull and I knew my sharpening block was in storage, so I dropped by Public Storage for the first time in a while on the 24th. When I arrived at my unit, for a moment I thought I had somehow stopped at the wrong G97 because someone else's lock was on the unit. After double-checking my sanity and the unit, I realized someone had cut my lock. I talked to the on-site employee and he said his boss wouldn't be able to come by and cut it until Monday, so I went home dreading what would be missing.

Come Monday, I made the half hour drive back to Public Storage and unlocked the unit with the new key they had given me. Everything had been thrown around. The first thing I noticed missing was my old motorcycle. I had expected it but was still hoping the old tires, cludgy transmission, and the destroyed fairings might've disuaded the thieves. A large, 40-gallon stock pot was the next thing I noticed missing when I discovered my handmade pottery, that I stored in the pot, smashed on the ground. As I picked through the debris, I slowly realized more and more had been taken – things I had forgotten I was storing. The worst of which were my old tax documents, so now I get to be worried about identify theft.

I made a police report and filed an insurance claim, and now I'm just waiting to hear back from both. Experiencing theft was a brand new experience for me. I've heard it can change people, making them bitter and distrustful, which I can understand, but right now I'm just sad – that someone lived a life desperate enough to do something like that – and worried about the ongoing consequences.
