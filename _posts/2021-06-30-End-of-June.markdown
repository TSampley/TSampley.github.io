## Homebase
Today, the 30th of this month, I was finally approved for an apartment! I'll be paying more than I wanted to, but all the apartments in my desired range were income restricted and I make too much now.

I've been homeless since arriving in Kentucky, so it's a relief to know I'll soon have my own space where I can relax with privacy and security. I've been staying in my car most of the time at a Flying J gas station south of Louisville, but I also spent some time in hotels – mainly a couple weeks in a nice new Motel 6 that had the cheapest rooms in Louisville thanks to being right next to the airport. When I wasn't staying at a hotel, I took advantage of my Planet Fitness membership to keep clean. All things considered being homeless wasn't that bad since I have a car, but I am still looking forward to having my own private space for the first time in a while.
