Well, it's the day after my last exam and I feel so much better. Even after that
crammed schedule, I'd like to study more Statistics to understand more about the
derivations for all the curves.

I can appreciate the application of statistics to daily life; while driving, I
recently find myself thinking about different apps I could design to track
various data points about my life and extract some conclusions. On a more
directly relevant level, I looked up the monthly census data after recently
hearing about "unemployment truthers" to run the numbers myself just for fun.
The process was so simple, I didn't actually need to use anything from my recent
Stat class, but the class has put me in a more investigative and critical frame
of mind when presented with data.

It's a big relief, though to be able to take a moment to breath and spend
a little time on programming again. Unfortunately, at my current job, our latest
assistant manager left with no warning for something that paid higher, so I may
not get as much time as I'd like before school starts again.

However, a friend at work told me about a group called
[Techlahoma](https://www.techlahoma.org/). I joined a couple days ago and posted
a short blurb about myself asking for advice, and the response was incredibly
encouraging. It looks like getting a remote position may be a possibility. I had
dreamed about it before but never considered it seriously. A remote position
would be ideal while I'm completing my degree, but being able to program for
work at all would be amazing. I try to keep my mind active at work, thinking
about problems and working things out in my head, but it's the kind of work that
requires just enough attention to be cognitively disruptive yet not enough to be
stimulating. Of course the inevitable pay increase would make things easier as
well, but that's less important than my degree right now.
