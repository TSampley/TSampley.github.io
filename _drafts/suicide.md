title: Suicide as a Group Adaptation

It may at first seem contradictory that evolution would create organisms that can be driven to kill themselves, but we need to remind ourselves that evolution works on a larger scale than the individual. If something increases the odds of some given genetics being carried on, that's all that's needed to make those traits more dominant in a population.

Suicidal behavior is found across the animal kingdom; of course describing it as suicide is controversial, because many researchers anthropomorphise and assume that suicide requires higher cognitive abilities exclusive to human beings. Whether or not other animals possess these higher cognitive abilities doesn't matter so much to me - though I definitely don't think humans are as special as we love to imagine - because I don't see why it would be necessary for whatever cognitive abilities to drive a self-referential decision to halt all normal action anticipating ones own end. After-all, regardless of the complexity of some thought, all decisions are ultimately driven by the interplay of chemicals in the brain.
Humans, with our societies and wealth of ideas exchanged through literature over millennia, definitely have a higher capacity for abstractions about the world around us, but it's naive to assume that abstraction is necessary for suicide.

Natural disasters have been unavoidable for the majority of human history and have brought with them significant reductions to the productive capacity of civilizations.
The fragility of individuals gives rise to resilience of the group.
This can be imagined if you compare two groups of humans: one where the members are emotionally resilient and the thought of death never enters their mind regardless of their suffering, contrasted with another where some bow out from the stress before others. The former group could potentially exhaust all local resources until there's nothing left for anyone, leading to total collapse; the latter group slowly shrinks in size - and resource demand - as resources become progressively more scarce, softening the collapse of a population, giving a greater chance of recovery.

## The Hypothesis
In regards to the mechanisms behind the evolution of suicide, I believe there are a few necessary components:
1. Group members must be capable of feeling stress - universal as far as I'm aware.
2. The stress response must be highly variable - either through genetic sensitivity or more complex interactions like general sensitivity exacerbated by environmental or incidental stressors, like childhood abuse.

When some species begin to dominate an ecosystem, cannibalism often develops. Dominating an ecosystem can lead to the same stressors through competition like resource scarcity, which begs the question: why would some species develop suicide and some develop cannibalism? I believe it has to do with the degree of sociality of the species. In more cognizant species, taboo likely plays a role as well.
