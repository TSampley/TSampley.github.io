We are all born blank as slates, but an important question that is always skipped over (as far as I have seen) is the material of the slate. It might be made of marble, green clay, or chalk, of cement with coarse aggregate, laminated fiberglass and resin, or shale. Each responds in its own way to the force of tools on its surface. Some take the force directly, breaking or flaking predictably according to the mason's vision; some channel or direct the force according to their own unique characteristics, requiring great care or completely baffling an inexperienced or presumptuous mason.
You may try to etch the exact same carvings or characters into many different slates, but some will take all characters smoothly and equally, and some will be prone to reject some characters, but only in that spot - try somewhere else and you may not encounter any obstacles.

Autists have exceptionally good reasoning about physical systems - we are in some way more closely connected to reality. We have a strong sense of justice and - 
When a tyrant tries to etch lies on our surface, we not only reject those mistruths, we bleed and cry and we struggle against the perpetrator who would dare to defy reality itself.

"autistic" is a misnomer. We are not "self-focused" and "allistics" are not "other-focused". Bizarrely, these two labels are switched. The social policies that allistics follow are entirely self-serving, while autistics often care more about others than their own well-being. It stems from early ableist interpretations of the first children labeled "autistic" - it stems from the ironically self-centered interpretation by allistics: "they're not interested in ME, so they must not be interested in anyone but themselves".
