## Ethics
The tool we use to modulate our behavior and influence the behavior of others
Ethics is the tool we use to model ours and others behaviors and to evaluate our actions to pass judgement, whether consistently or not - the selective use of ethics is a misuse of the tool.
## Politics
The tool we use to shape our world and restrict the actions of others.
Politics is the tool we use to influence our world on a larger or systemic scale.
## Language
The tool we use to communicate
## Money
The tool we use to exchange value with each other.
Money is a tool that is meant to fascilitate the exchange of goods amongst individuals. A Capitalist will tell you that the magic of the open market is its ability to satisfy all desires most efficiently when everyone focuses on their individual needs.
