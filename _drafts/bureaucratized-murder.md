title: Bureaucratized Murder
subtitle: You Are Complicit

---

I like to think that I'm a compassionate individual; if I met someone who was going through addiction and slowly losing everything they had worked for in life, I would want to sit down with them and get to know them over a nice meal and try to figure out how I can help them - or just listen if that's what they need. But when that same person becomes increasingly desperate and starts to steal or mug people at knife-point in a dark alley, I can't blame anyone for defending their property or themselves, and if in the worst case, the mugger ends up dead, I can't fault the victim. While there are some who think all violence is unjust even for defense, the principle of self-defense is widely accepted, but it tends to be extremely limited in its recognition over time and space.
With the upcoming cuts to medicaid, it seems like more and more people are waking up to the idea that their lives can be signed away.
Truly, the pen is mightier than the sword: a single sword can cut, but a pen can direct hundreds or thousands of swords.

Boards of directors, executives, nurses, doctors, insurance adjusters, call center agents, you are all complicit. Obviously, some have more power than others

From each as they're able; to each as they need.
