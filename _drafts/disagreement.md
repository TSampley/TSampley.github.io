title: Disagree to Agree
subtitle: 

---

I have long been disgusted by the phrase "agree to disagree". It always seemed like a cowardly way to run from a discussion someone wasn't mentally prepared to address; it's a way of justifying a closed-minded perspective as a thinly veiled attempt at politeness. Then again, "polite" is just a polite word for dishonest, and "professional" is just a professional word for bullshit. TODO - replace link after publishing referred article
