Matt Kinderschild. Used his own child as a shield. Leave it to a snake to defend the snake pit.
Let's call him Peter Scheisseman. He talked over others frequently; it was clear he only cared about putting ideas out that he could claim credit for and frequently downplayed the accomplishments of others. He completely misunderstood the point I was making, and a big smile spread across his face before he turned his camera off and checked-out of the rest of the meeting.James Junior. Put network code, including a request and deserializing the request, on the main

```kotlin
fun assetRequest(/*parameters*/) {
  withContext(Dispatchers.Main) {
    // network request
    // deserialize response
    // callback(result)
  }
}
```
