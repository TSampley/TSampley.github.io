title: Fast Lions
---

Most lions must learn how to stalk and pounce in order to catch their prey, but an exceptionally fast lion doesn't need to – at least when times are good; when resources become scarce, and it's increasingly important to conserve energy, an exceptionally exhausting strategy like chasing down prey with sheer speed becomes impractical while efficient strategies like stalking outperform an exhausted, fast lion, which finds itself suddenly unable to keep up without the skills it never needed before.
